                Java developer with 6 years experience developing commercial web applications. I have a proven track record of delivering complex projects within a small development team, and have experience working in other stages of the development lifecycle, such as requirement analysis and testing.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                I am looking to join a cutting edge development team, within a fast paced and ambitious organisation that will challenge me on a daily basis. I'm a self-motivated and determined team player who is seeking new challenges to further develop skills and experience.
