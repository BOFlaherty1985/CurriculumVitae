                I was part of a five man Java developer team, implementing mainx.web based applications for both internal and external users. The largest application that I worked on was the organisations online quote system, which enabled external brokers to quote, adjust and renew insurance policies online.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                These mainx.web applications were predominantly developed using Java and Spring, and due to the size of the development team, we used a number of agile techniques to improve project delivery. I gained valuable experience in gathering and understanding business requirements, and in building successful working relationship with our testing teams and business users.

                During my sandwich year at university I spent 12 months on an industrial placement (Aftersales Internship) at Rolls-Royce in Chichester.  I worked within the warranty and service department dealing with dealership queries, claims and technical assistance, including the implementation of a new computer system (Warranty Extranet Europe).
                <br/>
                <br/>
                During the placement I was also involved with several other projects including monthly warranty provision calculations for the finance department and the long range plan budget for a new vehicle model.
